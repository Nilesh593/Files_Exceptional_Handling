    "Scenarios Where Multithreading is Preferable:\n",
    "I/O-bound Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "When tasks involve a lot of waiting for external resources, such as reading from or writing to files, network communication, or database access, multithreading is preferable. This is because threads can easily switch between tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "Example: A web server handling multiple client requests or a program downloading data from multiple URLs simultaneously.\n",
    "Shared Memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "If tasks need to communicate frequently or share data, multithreading is ideal because threads operate in the same memory space. This allows easy data sharing without the need for complex inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "Example: A GUI application where multiple components (like a progress bar and a file loader) need to share state and work together smoothly.\n",
    "Low Overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are lightweight compared to processes, so if the task involves relatively light workloads and doesnâ€™t require high CPU usage, multithreading introduces less overhead in terms of memory and resource usage.\n",
    "Example: Lightweight background tasks like monitoring or logging in an application.\n",
    "Limited CPU Cores:\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on a system with fewer CPU cores or when the task doesn't benefit much from parallel processing, multithreading is a better fit. It helps avoid unnecessary overhead from spawning multiple processes.\n",
    "Scenarios Where Multiprocessing is Preferable:\n",
    "CPU-bound Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tasks are computationally intensive and require heavy processing power (e.g., complex calculations, machine learning training, large data processing), multiprocessing is preferable. It takes full advantage of multiple CPU cores, allowing true parallelism.\n",
    "Example: Image or video processing, scientific simulations, and large-scale data analysis.\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) Limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. This means that even multithreaded programs might not fully utilize CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks. Multiprocessing avoids this by creating separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and GIL.\n",
    "Example: Tasks like matrix multiplications, numerical computations, or cryptography where raw CPU performance matters.\n",
    "Process Isolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If tasks need to be run in isolated environments where their failure should not impact others, multiprocessing is safer. Each process runs independently, with its own memory space, preventing memory corruption or data inconsistency.\n",
    "Example: Running different machine learning models in parallel or sandboxing tasks where failures must be isolated.\n",
    "Parallelism Across Multiple Cores:\n",
    "\n",
    "On systems with multiple CPU cores, multiprocessing allows true parallelism, where each process can run simultaneously on different cores without being constrained by the GIL.\n",
    "Example: Running multiple simulations or tasks that can be divided into independent subtasks, such as web scraping across multiple URLs.\n"

    "### 1. **Methods and Tools for Sharing Data Between Threads**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since threads share the same memory space, synchronization tools are necessary to avoid race conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`threading.Lock`**:\n",
    "  - A **Lock** ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.\n",
    "  - Threads must acquire the lock before modifying shared data and release it afterward.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "  with lock:\n",
    "      # Safe access to shared resource\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`threading.RLock`**:\n",
    "  - A **Reentrant Lock** (RLock) is a lock that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread without causing a deadlock.\n",
    "  - Useful in cases where a thread needs to acquire the lock again before releasing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`threading.Condition`**:\n",
    "  - A **Condition** is used to allow threads to wait for certain conditions to be met before continuing. It's useful when multiple threads need to coordinate the use of a shared resource.\n",
    "  - Condition works with a Lock to notify waiting threads when the resource becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`threading.Semaphore`**:\n",
    "  - A **Semaphore** limits the number of threads that can access a shared resource at the same time.\n",
    "  - For example, a `Semaphore(3)` allows only three threads to access the resource concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`threading.Event`**:\n",
    "  - An **Event** is a simple flag that threads can set or clear to signal the occurrence of an event, helping to synchronize actions between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Methods and Tools for Sharing Data Between Processes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike threads, processes in Python have separate memory spaces, so they cannot directly share data. Python's `multiprocessing` module provides several mechanisms to safely share data between processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`multiprocessing.Queue`**:\n",
    "  - A **Queue** allows processes to exchange data in a thread-safe manner.\n",
    "  - It uses a FIFO (First In, First Out) structure and can be shared between processes without the need for locks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from multiprocessing import Queue\n",
    "  q = Queue()\n",
    "  q.put(data)\n",
    "  data = q.get()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`multiprocessing.Pipe`**:\n",
    "  - A **Pipe** is a communication channel between two processes.\n",
    "  - Pipes are two-way (duplex) communication structures where data can flow between processes in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`multiprocessing.Manager`**:\n",
    "  - A **Manager** provides shared objects like lists, dictionaries, and other data types that can be safely accessed by multiple processes.\n",
    "  - For example, a manager can create a list that can be modified by different processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from multiprocessing import Manager\n",
    "  manager = Manager()\n",
    "  shared_list = manager.list()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`multiprocessing.Value` and `multiprocessing.Array`**:\n",
    "  - These provide a way to share simple data types (like integers or floats) and arrays between processes.\n",
    "  - They allow controlled, synchronized access to data by using shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from multiprocessing import Value\n",
    "  shared_value = Value('i', 0)  # 'i' means integer\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Higher-Level Abstractions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`concurrent.futures` module**:\n",
    "  - This module provides high-level interfaces for managing threads (`ThreadPoolExecutor`) and processes (`ProcessPoolExecutor`).\n",
    "  - It abstracts the lower-level details of managing threads and processes and allows sharing data safely with built-in mechanisms to handle results and exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "  with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n",
    "      results = executor.map(some_function, data_list)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Between Threads**:\n",
    "  - Tools: `Lock`, `RLock`, `Condition`, `Semaphore`, `Event`.\n",
    "  - Threads share the same memory space, so these synchronization tools help ensure thread-safe access to shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Between Processes**:\n",
    "  - Tools: `Queue`, `Pipe`, `Manager`, `Value`, `Array`.\n",

    "### Why Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs is Crucial\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Preventing Application Crashes**:\r\n",
    "   - In concurrent programs (using threads or processes), an unhandled exception in one thread or process can cause the entire program or other tasks to fail, resulting in an application crash. Proper exception handling ensures that individual tasks can fail without bringing down the entire application.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Ensuring Task Completion**:\r\n",
    "   - Exceptions can disrupt the normal flow of execution, leaving tasks incomplete or in an inconsistent state. In a concurrent system, this can lead to missed deadlines, incomplete results, or improper task sequencing. Handling exceptions ensures tasks can gracefully recover or retry as needed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Resource Leaks**:\r\n",
    "   - If exceptions are not handled, resources like file handles, network connections, or memory may not be properly released, leading to resource leaks. This can degrade the performance of the program over time and potentially cause system-level issues.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Maintaining Data Integrity**:\r\n",
    "   - In concurrent programs, multiple tasks might be working on shared data. If an exception occurs without being handled, it can leave shared resources or data in an inconsistent state, leading to race conditions, deadlocks, or incorrect data.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "5. **Debugging and Monitoring**:\r\n",
    "   - Proper exception handling allows developers to log or trace the source of errors in concurrent programs. This is critical for debugging complex systems where multiple threads or processes are running at the same time, making it harder to track the root cause of an issue.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Techniques for Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 1. **Try-Except Blocks in Threads or Processes**:\r\n",
    "   - A basic approach is to wrap the concurrent taskâ€™s code in a `try-except` block. This ensures that exceptions are caught and can be handled appropriately.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   Example for a thread:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import threading\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   def task():\r\n",
    "       try:\r\n",
    "           # Task logic here\r\n",
    "           1 / 0  # Simulating an exception\r\n",
    "       except Exception as e:\r\n",
    "           print(f\"Exception in thread: {e}\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   t = threading.Thread(target=task)\r\n",
    "   t.start()\r\n",
    "   t.join()\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   Similarly, you can use the same approach in a multiprocessing task.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 2. **Using `concurrent.futures` for Automatic Exception Propagation**:\r\n",
    "   - The `concurrent.futures` module (`ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor`) automatically propagates exceptions raised by threads or processes. You can catch these exceptions when you retrieve the results from the future objects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   Example:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   def task(n):\r\n",
    "       return 1 / n\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\r\n",
    "       futures = [executor.submit(task, n) for n in [1, 0, 2]]\r\n",
    "       for future in futures:\r\n",
    "           try:\r\n",
    "               result = future.result()  # Will raise if there's an exception\r\n",
    "               print(f\"Result: {result}\")\r\n",
    "           except Exception as e:\r\n",
    "               print(f\"Exception caught: {e}\")\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   - In this example, the exception from the division by zero will be propagated when `future.result()` is called, and can be handled in the `except` block.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 3. **Threading and `sys.excepthook` for Unhandled Exceptions**:\r\n",
    "   - For multithreading, Python provides a way to handle uncaught exceptions globally using `sys.excepthook`. This can be helpful if you donâ€™t catch exceptions in individual threads.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   Example:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import threading\r\n",
    "   import sys\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   def handle_uncaught_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback):\r\n",
    "       print(f\"Uncaught exception: {exc_value}\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   sys.excepthook = handle_uncaught_exception\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   def task():\r\n",
    "       raise ValueError(\"Something went wrong\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   t = threading.Thread(target=task)\r\n",
    "   t.start()\r\n",
    "   t.join()\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 4. **Using Queues to Propagate Exceptions**:\r\n",
    "   - For more custom handling, especially in `multiprocessing`, you can use `multiprocessing.Queue` to propagate exceptions back to the main thread or process.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   Example:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import multiprocessing\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   def worker(q):\r\n",
    "       try:\r\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Error in process\")\r\n",
    "       except Exception as e:\r\n",
    "           q.put(e)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n",

    "   - A `finally` block ensures that resources are cleaned up properly, even if an exception occurs. This is crucial in concurrent programs to avoid resource leaks.\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   Example:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   def task():\r\n",
    "       try:\r\n",
    "           # Some work here\r\n",

    "           print(\"Cleaning up resources\")\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 6. **Graceful Shutdown and Recovery**:\r\n",
    "   - Concurrent programs should have mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and shut down safely. For instance, ks for resource cleanup.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Effective exception handling makes concurrent programs more robust, predictable, and easier to maintain."

    "1. **`factorial(n)`**: This function takes a number `n` and returns its factorial using Python's built-in `math.factorial()` function.\n",
    "2. **`numbers = range(1, 11)`**: A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created for which we will calculate the factorials.\n",
    "3. **`ThreadPoolExecutor`**: This manages a pool of threads. The `executor.map(factorial, numbers)` applies the `factorial` function to each number in the list concurrently.\n",
    "4. **`results`**: The results from `executor.map` are returned as an iterator, and we print the factorials of each number by iterating over the results.\n",
